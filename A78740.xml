         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Yet how neceſſary ſoever it appeared, We could not obtain Our own conſent to advance towards <hi>Brainford,</hi> and either pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſe it, or diſpoſſeſſe them of it, till We had ſatisfied Our ſelves that it was as lawfull as neceſſary, and fully weighed all, that not onely reaſon, but malice it<pb n="5" facs="tcp:156263:4"/>ſelf (which We knew to be very watchfull upon Our Actions) could object againſt it. We conſidered firſt that it could not reaſonably be eſteemed an averſion from Peace, and an intention to interrupt the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty then in expectation; Since on the other ſide We had cauſe to beleeve by the former rejection of Our offers of Treaty, when We were ſuppoſed to be in no condition of ſtrength, That if We would not thus preſerve Our Selves from being ſo encompaſſed as to come into their Powers, the very poſſibility of a Treaty would immediately vaniſh. We conſidered next, that much leſſe could it be interpreted any breach of Faith, ſince willingneſſe to receive Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of Treaty was never held to amount to a ſuſpenſion of Arms; Since otherwiſe We muſt (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe mention of a Treaty had been once made) by the ſame Logick have been bound not to hinder them to encompaſſe Vs on all parts to
<hi>Colebrook</hi> Towns end; Since no word to that purpoſe (of any ſuſpenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) was in Our Anſwer; Nay, ſince in that (by wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Propoſitions might be haſtned, to prevent the inconveniences which would intervene) We im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, that by this Arms were not ſuſpended; And ſince their own Votes of proceeding vigorouſly, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Petition, and their own actions, in ſending after their Meſſengers great ſtore of forces with Ordnance ſo neer to Vs (having before girt Vs in on all other parts, and ſent men and Ordnance to <hi>Kingſtone</hi> after the ſafe conduct asked of Vs) implied the ſame.</p>
            <p>Being reſolved upon theſe Reaſons, That this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing was neceſſary and juſt, We were not yet ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied<pb n="6" facs="tcp:156263:5"/>till We had endeavoured the ſame day (though the interruptions of ſhooting ſtopt up the way till the next) to ſatisfie Our Parliament and People of the ſame, and that Peace was ſtill Our deſire, We to that end directed a Meſſage by <hi>John White</hi> Eſquire, which was ſo received, that his danger of being put to death for bringing it, and the impriſonment of him and the Trumpeter that went with him in the Gatehouſe, ſhewed that the very Law of Nations was by ſome no more conſidered then all other Laws had been before. A Copy of which Meſſage hereafter follows, to ſhew how little temptation the matter of that gave them for ſuch an uſage.</p>

            <p>ANd to juſtifie yet further, that Our intention was no other then was here profeſt, aſſoon as We were informed that the Earl of
<hi>Eſſex</hi> his Forces were departed from <hi>Kingſtone,</hi> before any appearance or notice of further Forces from <hi>London,</hi> (Our end of not being incloſed being obtained) We gave or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to quit
<hi>Brainford,</hi> and to march away, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe that place.</p>
            <p>We cannot but make one Argument more of the truth of Our Profeſſion, that this was all Our end, and that We had not the leaſt thought, by ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing, to ſurpriſe and ſack <hi>London,</hi> (which the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant Party would infuſe into that Our City) And that is, That probably God Almighty would not have given ſuch a Bleſſing to Our journey, as to have aſſiſted Vs ſo both by Land and Water, as with leſſe then a third part of Our Foot, and with the loſſe but of ten men, to beat two of their beſt Regiments out of both <hi>Brainfords,</hi> for all the great advantage of their works in them, to kill him who commanded in chief, and kill and drown many others, To take five hundred Priſoners, more Arms, eleven Colours, and good ſtore of Ammunition, fifteen pieces of Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, (whereof We ſunk moſt that We brought not away) and then unfought with, and unoffered at, neerer then by Ordnance, to march away, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the great diſadvantage of Our Forces by<pb n="8" facs="tcp:156263:6"/>the difficulties of the Paſſages, if He, who is the Searcher of all hearts, and Truth it ſelf, had not known the truth of Our Profeſſions, and the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie of Our heart, and how far We were from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving thoſe horrid Accuſations of Falſhood, and Treachery caſt ſo point blank upon Our own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that it would amaſe any man to ſee them ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be printed in Our City of
<hi>London,</hi> if any thing of that kinde could be a wonder, after ſo many of the ſame, and how really they deſire Accommodation, who upon this have Voted they will have none.</p>
            <p>Theſe Our Reaſons for this Action, This Our ſatisfaction ſent for it, and this Bleſſing of Gods up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, will (We doubt not) cleer Vs to all indifferent perſons both of the Ieſuiticall Counſells, and the perſonall Treachery to which ſome have preſumed ſo impudently to impute it; And God ſo bleſſe Our future Actions, as We have deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the truth of this.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O Your Majeſties Meſſage of the twelfth of this Moneth of November, We the Lords and Commons in Parliament do make this humble Anſwer; That this Meſſage was not delivered to us till Monday the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. We thought it a ſtrange Introduction to Peace, that Your Majeſty ſhould ſend Your Army to beat us out of our Quarters at <hi>Brainford,</hi> and then appoint that place to receive our Propoſitions, which, yet it plainly appears, Your Majeſtie intended not to receive, till You had firſt tryed, whether You could break thorow the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my raiſed for the defence of this Kingdome and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and take the City being unprovided and ſecure in expectation of a fair Treaty made to ſecure the City. If herein Your Majeſty had prevailed, after You had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed the Army, and maſtered the City, it is eaſie to imagine what a miſerable Peace we ſhould have had, and whether thoſe courſes be ſutable to the expreſſions Your Majeſtie is pleaſed to make in Your Anſwer to our Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, of Your earneſtneſſe to avoid any further effuſion of blood, let God and the world judge.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:156263:7"/>As for our Proceedings, they have in all things been an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to our Profeſſions: we gave directions to the Earl of
<hi>Eſſex</hi> to draw the Army under his Command out of the City and Suburbs, before we ſent any Meſſage to Your Majeſty: So that part of it was inquartered at <hi>Brain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> before the Committee returned with Your Anſwer. And immediatly upon the receit thereof, that very mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Order was taken that the Souldiers ſhould exerciſe no act of hoſtility againſt any of Your Majeſties people. We ſent a letter by Sir <hi>Peter Killigrew</hi> to know Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties pleaſure whether you intended the like forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of hoſtility. But the fury of Your Souldiers, thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting after blood and ſpoil, prevented the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the letter. For coming upon Saturday in his way towards Your Majeſtie as far as <hi>Brainford,</hi> he found them in fight there, and could paſſe no further. God who ſees our innocencie, and that we have no aims, but at his glory, and the publike good, will (we hope) free Your Majeſtie from thoſe deſtructive Counſels who labour to maintain their own power by blood and rapine, and bleſſe our endeavours, who ſeek nothing, but to procure and eſtabliſh the Honour, Peace and Safety of Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie and Kingdoms, upon the ſure foundation of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Juſtice.</p>

            <head>To the Anſwer of both HOUSES of Parliament to His MAjESTIES Meſſage of the twelfth of November, His MAjESTIE makes this REPLY.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat His Meſſage of the twelfth, though not received by them till the <hi>14<hi rend="sup">th</hi>,</hi> was ſent to them firſt upon the ſame day upon which it was dated, and, meeting with ſtops by the way, was again ſent upon the thirteenth, and taken upon that day at ten in the morning by the Earl of
<hi>Eſſex,</hi> and though not to him directed, was by him opened, ſo the ſlowneſſe of the Delivery is not ſo ſtrange as the ſtop of the Letter ſaid to be ſent by Sir <hi>Peter Killigrew,</hi> which His Majeſtie hath not yet received, but concludes from the matter expreſſed to have been contained in that Letter (to wit, to know His Pleaſure, whether He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the forbearance of Hoſtility) and by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of ſuch forbearance ſaid to be ſent to the Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> his Army, that no ſuch forbearance was already concluded, and conſequently neither had His Majeſtie cauſe to ſuppoſe, that He ſhould take any of their Forces unprovided and ſecure in expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of a fair Treaty, neither could any Hoſtile<pb n="12" facs="tcp:156263:8"/>Act of His Majeſties Forces have been a courſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſutable to His expreſſions, much leſſe could an endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to prepoſſeſſe (for ſo He hoped He might have done) that Place, which might have ſtopt the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther March of thoſe Forces towards Him (which, for ought appeared to Him, might as well have been intended to
<hi>Colebrook</hi> as to <hi>Brainford</hi>) and by that the further effuſion of blood, deſerve that ſtyle.</p>
            <p>His Majeſtie further conceives, That the printing ſo out of time of ſuch a Declaration, as their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to His Anſwer to theirs of the ſir and twentieth of May, but the day before they Voted the delivery of their Petition, and the March of the Earl of <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex</hi> his Forces to
<hi>Brainford</hi> ſo neer to His Majeſtie, when the Committee at the ſame time attended Him with a Petition for a Treaty, the Earle of
<hi>Eſſex</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before poſſeſt of all the other Avenues to his Army, by his Forces at <hi>Windſore, Acton,</hi> and <hi>Kingſtone,</hi> was a more ſtrange introduction to Peace, then for His Majeſtie not to ſuffer Himſelf to be coopt up on all ſides, becauſe a Treaty had been mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which was ſo really and ſo much deſired by His Majeſtie, that this Proceeding ſeems to Him pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely by ſome intended to divert (which it could not do) that His Inclination.</p>
            <p>That His Majeſtie had no intention to maſter the City by ſo advancing, beſides His Profeſſion, which (how meanly ſoever they ſeem to value it) He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives a ſufficient Argument (eſpecially being on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppoſed by Suſpicions and Surmiſes) may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by His not purſuing His Victory at <hi>Brainford,</hi> but giving Orders to His Army to march away to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:156263:8"/>
               <hi>Kingſtone</hi> as ſoon as He heard that place was quitted, before any notice or appearance of further Forces from
<hi>London;</hi> Nor could He finde a better way to ſatisfie them before hand, that He had no ſuch inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but that His deſire of Peace, and of Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that might conduce to it, ſtill continued, then by that Meſſage of the twelfth, for which care of His He was requited by ſuch a Reception of His Meſſage and Meſſenger, as was contrary at once both to Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, Civilitie, and the very Cuſtoms, and Law of War, and Nations, and ſuch as theirs (though after this Provocation) hath not found from Him.</p>
            <p>His Majeſtie wonders that His Souldiers ſhould be charged with thirſting after Blood, who took above five hundred Priſoners in the very heat of the fight, His Majeſtie having ſince diſmiſſed all the common Souldiers, and entertained ſuch as were willing to ſerve Him, and required onely from the reſt an Oath not to ſerve againſt Him: And His Majeſtie ſuppoſes ſuch moſt apt and likely to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their Power by Blood and Rapine, who have onely got it by Oppreſſion and Injuſtice; That His is veſted in Him by the Law, and by that onely (if the deſtructive Counſels of others would not hinder ſuch a Peace, in which that might once again be the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall Rule, and in which Religion and Iuſtice can onely flouriſh) He deſires to maintain it. And if Peace were equally deſired by them, as it is by His Majeſtie, He conceives it would have been proper to have ſent him ſuch a Paper as ſhould have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained juſt Propoſitions of Peace, and not an unjuſt Accuſation of His Counſels, Proceedings and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.<pb n="14" facs="tcp:156263:9"/>And His Majeſtie intends to march to ſuch a diſtance from His City of <hi>London,</hi> as may take away all pretence of apprehenſion from His Army, that might hinder them in all ſecurity from yet preparing them to preſent to Him, and there will be ready ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to receive them, or to end the preſſures, and miſeries, which His Subjects to His great grief ſuffer through this War, by a preſent Battell.</p>
